IDEA:

Can we build a API/DSL inside C++ that allows you to drop in, define a web interface
and API for your C++ code, and it'll generate the client-server stuff for you?

We can make this a bit like [Wt](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) but rather make it
like an RPC interface, lightweight and drops into a current project.
